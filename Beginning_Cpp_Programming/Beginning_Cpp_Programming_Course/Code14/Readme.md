# If Statement - Can you Drive?
## In this exercise you will use a simple if  statement to decide if someone can drive. Let's assume that anyone 16 or older can legally drive.

* If the person can legally drive, your program should display, "Yes - you can drive!" using a cout  statement. You do not have to provide a '\n'  or endl .

* If the person cannot legally drive, then your program should not display anything.
