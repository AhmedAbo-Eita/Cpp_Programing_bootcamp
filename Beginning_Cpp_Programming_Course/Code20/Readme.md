# While loop exercise
Given a vector of integers, determine how many integers are present before you see the value `-99` .

* Note, it's possible `-99` is not in the vector! If `-99`  is not in the vector then the result will be equal to the number of elements in the vector.

* The final result should be stored in an integer variable named count .
