# If-Else Statement - Can you Drive?
## In this exercise you will use an simple if/else  statement to decide if someone can drive. Let's assume that anyone 16 or older can legally drive.

* If the person can legally drive, your program should display, "Yes - you can drive!" using a cout  statement. You do not have to provide a '\n' or endl .

* If the person cannot legally drive, then your program should display, "Sorry, come back in n  years", where n is how many years until the person turns 16 year old.
