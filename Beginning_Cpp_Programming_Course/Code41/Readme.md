# Creating and Accessing Objects
We have already declared a `C++ class` named `Dog`  that is located in `Dog.h` (we'll learn about header files later in this section).

In the `test_dog`  function create a `Dog  object` named `spot`  and, using the `.` operator, set the `name`  attribute to the string `"Spot"`  and the `age`  attribute to `5` .
