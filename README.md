#  C++ Programming Bootcamp

Welcome to my **C++ Programming Bootcamp repository**, where I document my journey through learning modern C++ and applying it to real-world mini-projects and Qt applications.


##  About the Bootcamp

This repository contains all the exercises, code samples, and projects I’ve worked on during a C++ bootcamp. The bootcamp covers core concepts in C++, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and GUI application development using **Qt**.



##  Technologies & Tools

- **C++17**
- **Qt 6** – for GUI projects using `qmake`
- **Standard Template Library (STL)** – vectors, maps, algorithms
- **Visual Studio Code / Qt Creator**
- **CMake/qmake** (depending on the project)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

# Lab Inventory Application 
One of the core projects in this bootcamp is the Lab Inventory Manager, a complete Qt application for managing components in an electronics lab.

## Features:
- Displays components in a table with sortable columns.
- Add, edit, search, and delete components.
- CSV import/export and auto-saving to a local inventory file.
- PDF preview of footprint selection guide.
- Reset to last saved state.
- Warning prompt on unsaved changes before closing.
- Tabbed interface for adding, searching, and editing components.
- Custom-styled table headers (green/gray).
- Automatically maximized window.
- Application icon and title for better identification.
